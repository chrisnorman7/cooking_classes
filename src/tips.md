# Tips

This section will attempt to collate general tips for doing things both throughout this course, and beyond.

## Safety

### Test when cold

Sooner rather than later, you will end up dealing with things that are hot. Whether that's sliding an oven pizza in and out on an oven tray, boiling pasta or potatoes, or even pouring a nice cup of [Yorkshire tea](https://www.yorkshiretea.co.uk/), you will need to be able to do things without touching hot surfaces.

Before (long before if possible) these problems arise, consider doing a cold run.

#### Kettles

Fill the kettle with cold water, and pour the cold water into your cup until you can do it without spilling. Then practise with the kettle half-boiled. Slowly work your way up until the kettle is fully boiled.

#### Ovens

Take a baking tray and fill it with things that rattle, like marbles, or dice, or screws, or even cutlery. Practise taking it from the kitchen side, and putting it into a cold oven, and closing the oven door. Do all of this with bare hands (ensuring the oven is cold first).

Walk around your kitchen, open the oven door, and get your tray out.

When you can do that with a minimum of rattling, repeat with oven gloves on. Then warm the oven a little (50 degrees will be warm, but not hot), and do the same.

Pro TIP: You can do the same with barbecues before they are lit.

#### Pans

Fill your pans (both frying pans and saucepans) with cold water, and practise walking around with them. Do this with bare feet, so you'll feel any water that drops on your feet.

Keep doing this until you don't spill anything, and bear in mind, that even if you half fill a pan before cooking, water increases in volume when boiling, so it might appear far fuller when it has been on the heat for a while.

Pro TIP 1: Put whatever you are boiling in the pan before you put the water in, so you don't end up with a much higher water level than you expect.

Pro TIP 2: Experiment with using a bigger pan than you think you'll need. The sides will be higher, so there's less chance of the pan boiling over, oil splashing ETC. This is safer, more pleasant for you when cooking, and will likely result in less mess.

### Telling when a pan is centred

If you're using a gas hob, you can get a good idea if the pan is centred by holding your hand (palm or back) above your pan, and feeling for the hot air that rises. If your pan is not centred, you will likely feel extra hot air to the side you need to move the pan towards, to centre it over the flame.

When positioning your hand, start with it as high in the air as you can reach, then slowly bring it down until you feel the heat. Over time, no matter how tall you are, you will come to remember how high is too high, and how low is getting uncomfortable.

Irrespective what hob you're using, assuming it is not a [hotplate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hotplate) or an [induction hob](https://www.cookersandovens.co.uk/blog/what-is-induction/), you can feel where about the pan should be situated before you apply any heat.

Pro TIP 1: In my experience (not scientific fact), the edge of a wok is usually warm rather than hot, so you can touch it to make sure the pan is the same temperature all the way around.

Pro TIP 2: If you're feeling your way around a pan, bounce your finger rather than dragging it. That way, if you do find it too hot, you'll realise your mistake before any kind of damage is done.

Pro TIP 3: Have a bowl of cold water run. That way, even if you do burn yourself, you can quickly submerge your finger in cold water to prevent the skin from burning. If you don't have a sink bowl, or you'd rather fill the sink with washing up, running cold water works just as well.

### Draining things

- Always drain over an empty sink. The hot water can run away, and most colanders have a base, so you can sit them in the sink, and use both hands for holding / directing the pan.
- Don't lean over when draining hot liquids. You might be tempted to lean towards your pan to hear how fas you are pouring, but there will most likely be a rush of steam which will rise when pouring, and if you're too close, it make your eyes water a bit.
