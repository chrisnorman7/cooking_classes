# Red Lentil Dahl

## Background

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahl), Dahl refers to a dish, or the preparation of lentils or other pulses. When I use the word, I'm referring to an indian stew which tastes a little like heaven, and is as easy to make as the previous [stew](stew.md).

## Preparation

We're going to be using red lentils for this particular dahl, although feel free to try with other colours.

Red lentils are amazing. They're so cheep, and they're dried, so they basically last forever. Whether preparing for curry night, or the apocalypse , have some lentils on hand, they'll save your life.

As a guide, half a cup of lentils will serve two people. Use three quarters or a whole cup, if you're feeling extra hungry, and you want some lefter over for breakfast (because curry for breakfast isn't just for students).

## Method

As I said in the [introduction to this section](week_1.md), the basic steps to any stew are:

- Put ingredients into something for cooking
- Add water
- Cook

This dahl is another form of [stew](stew.md), so it's very similar:

- Put the lentils in the pan.
- Add whatever veg you like: spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, garden peas ETC.
- Add a tin of coconut milk.
- Add whatever spices you like: Cumin, smoked paprika, turmeric (this will stain your entire life), garam masala, black pepper.
- If you need more liquid, add more water.
- Optionally, crumble a stock cube into the mixture.
- Turn onto a medium heat.
- Cook until the lentils have turned to a mashed potato consistency, and all your veg is cooked, about 20-40 minutes. Make sure to stir every couple of minutes so the lentils do not stick to your pan.
