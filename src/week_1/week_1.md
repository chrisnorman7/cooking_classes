# Week 1: Gravy

## Background

I'll let you in on a secret: Most things are "Gravy", where gravy is liquid (water, wine, stock), with stuff (meat, vegetables, beans, lentils) in it.

This goes for soups, stews (what's the difference anyway?) curries, and to a lesser extent, things like Spaghetti Bolognese.

In this 4-week block, we'll be visiting some firm favourites, all of which boil down (pun definitely intended) to you putting stuff in a pan, adding water and / or sauce, and cooking until you're happy.

## Cooking Appliance

The most obvious way to cook any stew is in a saucepan. This isn't strictly necessary however, as you could just as easily use a rice cooker or a slow cooker. Someone on the internet even made a [chicken casserole](https://hintofhelen.com/actifry-chicken-casserole/) in an [ActiFry](https://www.tefal.co.uk/actifry).

If it can hold water, and you can apply heat to it, you can cook a stew in it.

## Serving

When it comes to serving stews, bear in mind that whatever you cooked in, there will still be hot water in it.

The easiest way around this is to loudly claim that as you cooked, someone else can serve up. If you cannot summon anyone to do the job for you though, use something like a ladle, and hold the bowl you're serving into over the pan you're serving from. That way, any splashes should go back into the pan, and the worst you'you'll have to deal with is the side of your eating bowl being dirty.

Pro TIP 1: You can put your stew pan in an empty sink, then serve into bowls. Then if you spill stuff, just remove the stew pan - cleaning the sides and underside with a damp cloth - and rinse out the sink with water.

Pro TIP 2: I like to use a deep spoon, but one whose bowl is level with the handle, rather than at right angles, like most ladles are. I end up spilling less, because most things I old get held in line with my hand, so no extra brain work goes into angling anything.
