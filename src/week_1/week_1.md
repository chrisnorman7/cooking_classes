# Week 1: Gravy

I'll let you in on a secret: Most things are "Gravy", where gravy is liquid (water, wine, stock), with stuff (meat, vegetables, beans, lentils) in it.

This goes for soups, stews (what's the difference anyway?) curries, and to a lesser extent, things like Spaghetti Bolognese.

In this 4-week block, we'll be visiting some firm favourites, all of which boil down (pun definitely intended) to you putting stuff in a pan, adding water and / or sauce, and cooking until you're happy.
