# Stew

Calling this a recipe is a little insulting to recipes, but I won't tell if you don't!

The whole point of a stew is to heat up water with stuff in it, and it's possibly the most simple thing you can make. You can cook it in a simple saucepan, inside a [rice cooker](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-use-your-rice-cooker-482851) or [slow cooker](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-reviews/electricals/g25900206/best-slow-cookers-reviewed/), or even go old style, and cook over a fire.

According to [this article](https://foodsguy.com/difference-stew-and-casserole/), if you cook your stew in the oven, it magically becomes a casserole. So once you've got stews down, you can do casseroles too. Just make sure the pan you put in the oven has a lid which you can use, and no part of it is going to melt.

There are specific stews of course. One of my favourite things to eat in the world is [Foul](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/foul-mudammas-recipe/) (pronounced "full"), but they all amount to the same basic 3 steps:

- Add fresh ingredients
- Add water
- Cook

## Ingredients

If you're unsure of what to add, here's a list. You've probably got some lying around your kitchen. Try adding them to water (or stock), and seeing what you get:

- Potatoes
- Carrots
- Leeks
- Beans
- Mushrooms
- Gravy granules (not too many)
- Stock cube(s)
- Salt (be careful not to over-salt)
- Peppers of any colour
- Parsnips
- Sweet potato
- Celery
- Broccoli
- Cauliflower
- Meat
- Cream
- Sausages

## Method

When you've added whatever you like, cover it with water (so you can tap the ingredients and get a small splash, rather than a tidal wave), and put your pan on the stove. You want to set your stove to medium heat. After a while, the water will start to bubble, but it won't splash or rumble.

If you're unsure, start with the heat low, and turn it up until you're comfortable. You can always turn it down.

While cooking, occasionally (every 2-5 minutes), give it a stir with a spoon. You probably want to use wood, since metal might damage your pan, and plastic is [controversial](https://www.healthdigest.com/732241/are-plastic-utensils-bad-for-you/).

How long you cook your stew (or casserole) for will depend on what's in it. The best way to figure out if it's done cooking, is to poke around with a fork, and see if everything is cooked to your liking.

If you've used too much water (happens to the best of us), you can either keep cooking until the water boils off, or you "thicken" your stew with something like gravy granules, nutritional yeast, or corn starch.

Pro TIP: You might need to eat some bits, just to be sure. It's a hard job, but someone's got to do it.

## Serving Suggestions

In my humble opinion, the best way to serve stew is with bread and butter. If you've got home-made bread then all the better, but shop-bought will do just as well.
