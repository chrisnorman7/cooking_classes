# Introduction

Welcome to this cooking course. Created by Chris and Claire-Louise Norman, it aims to provide a gentle introduction to cooking for those who are blind or visually impaired.

This course will be run at [Coventry Resource Centre For The Blind](https://www.coventryblind.org.uk/), but the recipes are free for anyone to modify and use.

## Before You Start

Cooking as a blind person can be challenging: There are hot things everywhere, waiting for your onions to brown is confusing at best, and how exactly does one measure 100g anyway?

This course will attempt to simplify many commonplace dishes. It will not attempt to prepare you for Master Chef, and Mary Berry won't be hiring you any time soon, but it will endeavour to show you how to create enjoyable, balanced dishes that will see you right with mates or on dates, through film night, or world food night.

## Course Structure

The course is split into 4 sections:

- [Week 1](week_1/week_1.md) will demonstrate all things gravy.
- [Week 2](week_2/week_2.md) will go through the sacred art of frying.
- [Week 3](week_3/week_3.md) Will take you on a world tour of different foods.
- [Week 4](week_4/week_4.md) will have you making puddings like a pro.

Each section represents a 4-week block, where each week is a different recipe.

The final recipe of each block is something a little different, using different equipment, or just being a bit of fun.

Remember: You don't need to make every recipe if you don't want to, and very few of the ingredients can't be replaced.

## Afterword

The most important thing here is to have fun. The preparation, cooking and consumption of food is a huge part of cultures all over the world, and it's a part that blind and partially sighted people are more than capable of joining in with.

This course will attempt to teach you safe and simple best practises, but it most certainly isn't the only way to do all this stuff. You can and will find other ways of doing things for yourself. As long as you're happy doing things your own way, you stick with it, even if others find your methods unorthodox.
