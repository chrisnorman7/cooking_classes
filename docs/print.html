                        <h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to this cooking course. Created by Chris and Claire-Louise Norman, it aims to provide a gentle introduction to cooking for those who are blind or visually impaired.</p>
<p>This course will be run at <a href="https://www.coventryblind.org.uk/">Coventry Resource Centre For The Blind</a>, but the recipes are free for anyone to modify and use.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-start"><a class="header" href="#before-you-start">Before You Start</a></h2>
<p>Cooking as a blind person can be challenging: There are hot things everywhere, waiting for your onions to brown is confusing at best, and how exactly does one measure 100g anyway?</p>
<p>This course will attempt to simplify many commonplace dishes. It will not attempt to prepare you for Master Chef, and Mary Berry won't be hiring you any time soon, but it will endeavour to show you how to create enjoyable, balanced dishes that will see you right with mates or on dates, through film night, or world food night.</p>
<h2 id="course-structure"><a class="header" href="#course-structure">Course Structure</a></h2>
<p>The course is split into 4 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="week_1/week_1.html">Week 1</a> will demonstrate all things gravy.</li>
<li><a href="week_2/week_2.html">Week 2</a> will go through the sacred art of frying.</li>
<li><a href="week_3/week_3.html">Week 3</a> Will take you on a world tour of different foods.</li>
<li><a href="week_4/week_4.html">Week 4</a> will have you making puddings like a pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each section represents a 4-week block, where each week is a different recipe.</p>
<p>The final recipe of each block is something a little different, using different equipment, or just being a bit of fun.</p>
<p>Remember: You don't need to make every recipe if you don't want to, and very few of the ingredients can't be replaced.</p>
<h2 id="afterword"><a class="header" href="#afterword">Afterword</a></h2>
<p>The most important thing here is to have fun. The preparation, cooking and consumption of food is a huge part of cultures all over the world, and it's a part that blind and partially sighted people are more than capable of joining in with.</p>
<p>This course will attempt to teach you safe and simple best practises, but it most certainly isn't the only way to do all this stuff. You can and will find other ways of doing things for yourself. As long as you're happy doing things your own way, you stick with it, even if others find your methods unorthodox.</p>

<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>I'll let you in on a secret: Most things are &quot;Gravy&quot;, where gravy is liquid (water, wine, stock), with stuff (meat, vegetables, beans, lentils) in it.</p>
<p>This goes for soups, stews (what's the difference anyway?) curries, and to a lesser extent, things like Spaghetti Bolognese.</p>
<p>In this 4-week block, we'll be visiting some firm favourites, all of which boil down (pun definitely intended) to you putting stuff in a pan, adding water and / or sauce, and cooking until you're happy.</p>

<h2 id="cooking-appliance"><a class="header" href="#cooking-appliance">Cooking Appliance</a></h2>
<p>The most obvious way to cook any stew is in a saucepan. This isn't strictly necessary however, as you could just as easily use a rice cooker or a slow cooker. Someone on the internet even made a <a href="https://hintofhelen.com/actifry-chicken-casserole/">chicken casserole</a> in an <a href="https://www.tefal.co.uk/actifry">ActiFry</a>.</p>
<p>If it can hold water, and you can apply heat to it, you can cook a stew in it.</p>
<h2 id="serving"><a class="header" href="#serving">Serving</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to serving stews, bear in mind that whatever you cooked in, there will still be hot water in it.</p>
<p>The easiest way around this is to loudly claim that as you cooked, someone else can serve up. If you cannot summon anyone to do the job for you though, use something like a ladle, and hold the bowl you're serving into over the pan you're serving from. That way, any splashes should go back into the pan, and the worst you'you'll have to deal with is the side of your eating bowl being dirty.</p>
<p>Pro TIP 1: You can put your stew pan in an empty sink, then serve into bowls. Then if you spill stuff, just remove the stew pan - cleaning the sides and underside with a damp cloth - and rinse out the sink with water.</p>
<p>Pro TIP 2: I like to use a deep spoon, but one whose bowl is level with the handle, rather than at right angles, like most ladles are. I end up spilling less, because most things I old get held in line with my hand, so no extra brain work goes into angling anything.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stew"><a class="header" href="#stew">Stew</a></h1>
<p>Calling this a recipe is a little insulting to recipes, but I won't tell if you don't!</p>
<p>The whole point of a stew is to heat up water with stuff in it, and it's possibly the most simple thing you can make. You can cook it in a simple saucepan, inside a <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-use-your-rice-cooker-482851">rice cooker</a> or <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-reviews/electricals/g25900206/best-slow-cookers-reviewed/">slow cooker</a>, or even go old style, and cook over a fire.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://foodsguy.com/difference-stew-and-casserole/">this article</a>, if you cook your stew in the oven, it magically becomes a casserole. So once you've got stews down, you can do casseroles too. Just make sure the pan you put in the oven has a lid which you can use, and no part of it is going to melt.</p>
<p>There are specific stews of course. One of my favourite things to eat in the world is <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/foul-mudammas-recipe/">Foul</a> (pronounced &quot;full&quot;), but they all amount to the same basic 3 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add fresh ingredients</li>
<li>Add water</li>
<li>Cook</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ingredients"><a class="header" href="#ingredients">Ingredients</a></h2>
<p>If you're unsure of what to add, here's a list. You've probably got some lying around your kitchen. Try adding them to water (or stock), and seeing what you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Leeks</li>
<li>Beans</li>
<li>Mushrooms</li>
<li>Gravy granules (not too many)</li>
<li>Stock cube(s)</li>
<li>Salt (be careful not to over-salt)</li>
<li>Peppers of any colour</li>
<li>Parsnips</li>
<li>Sweet potato</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Cauliflower</li>
<li>Meat</li>
<li>Cream</li>
<li>Sausages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method"><a class="header" href="#method">Method</a></h2>
<p>When you've added whatever you like, cover it with water (so you can tap the ingredients and get a small splash, rather than a tidal wave), and put your pan on the stove. You want to set your stove to medium heat. After a while, the water will start to bubble, but it won't splash or rumble.</p>
<p>If you're unsure, start with the heat low, and turn it up until you're comfortable. You can always turn it down.</p>
<p>While cooking, occasionally (every 2-5 minutes), give it a stir with a spoon. You probably want to use wood, since metal might damage your pan, and plastic is <a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/732241/are-plastic-utensils-bad-for-you/">controversial</a>.</p>
<p>How long you cook your stew (or casserole) for will depend on what's in it. The best way to figure out if it's done cooking, is to poke around with a fork, and see if everything is cooked to your liking.</p>
<p>If you've used too much water (happens to the best of us), you can either keep cooking until the water boils off, or you &quot;thicken&quot; your stew with something like gravy granules, nutritional yeast, or corn starch.</p>
<p>Pro TIP: You might need to eat some bits, just to be sure. It's a hard job, but someone's got to do it.</p>
<h2 id="serving-suggestions"><a class="header" href="#serving-suggestions">Serving Suggestions</a></h2>
<p>In my humble opinion, the best way to serve stew is with bread and butter. If you've got home-made bread then all the better, but shop-bought will do just as well.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="red-lentil-dahl"><a class="header" href="#red-lentil-dahl">Red Lentil Dahl</a></h1>
<h2 id="background-1"><a class="header" href="#background-1">Background</a></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahl">Wikipedia</a>, Dahl refers to a dish, or the preparation of lentils or other pulses. When I use the word, I'm referring to an indian stew which tastes a little like heaven, and is as easy to make as the previous <a href="week_1/stew.html">stew</a>.</p>
<h2 id="preparation"><a class="header" href="#preparation">Preparation</a></h2>
<p>We're going to be using red lentils for this particular dahl, although feel free to try with other colours.</p>
<p>Red lentils are amazing. They're so cheep, and they're dried, so they basically last forever. Whether preparing for curry night, or the apocalypse , have some lentils on hand, they'll save your life.</p>
<p>As a guide, half a cup of lentils will serve two people. Use three quarters or a whole cup, if you're feeling extra hungry, and you want some lefter over for breakfast (because curry for breakfast isn't just for students).</p>
<h2 id="method-1"><a class="header" href="#method-1">Method</a></h2>
<p>As I said in the <a href="week_1/week_1.html">introduction to this section</a>, the basic steps to any stew are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put ingredients into something for cooking</li>
<li>Add water</li>
<li>Cook</li>
</ul>
<p>This dahl is another form of <a href="week_1/stew.html">stew</a>, so it's very similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the lentils in the pan.</li>
<li>Add whatever veg you like: spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, garden peas ETC.</li>
<li>Add a tin of coconut milk.</li>
<li>Add whatever spices you like: Cumin, smoked paprika, turmeric (this will stain your entire life), garam masala, black pepper.</li>
<li>If you need more liquid, add more water.</li>
<li>Optionally, crumble a stock cube into the mixture.</li>
<li>Turn onto a medium heat.</li>
<li>Cook until the lentils have turned to a mashed potato consistency, and all your veg is cooked, about 20-40 minutes. Make sure to stir every couple of minutes so the lentils do not stick to your pan.</li>
</ul>

<p>This section will attempt to collate general tips for doing things both throughout this course, and beyond.</p>
<p>If you have a suggestion, please <a href="mailto:chris.norman2@gmail.com">email</a> the author, or open an issue.</p>

<h3 id="test-when-cold"><a class="header" href="#test-when-cold">Test when cold</a></h3>
<p>Sooner rather than later, you will end up dealing with things that are hot. Whether that's sliding an oven pizza in and out on an oven tray, boiling pasta or potatoes, or even pouring a nice cup of <a href="https://www.yorkshiretea.co.uk/">Yorkshire tea</a>, you will need to be able to do things without touching hot surfaces.</p>
<p>Before (long before if possible) these problems arise, consider doing a cold run.</p>
<h4 id="kettles"><a class="header" href="#kettles">Kettles</a></h4>
<p>Fill the kettle with cold water, and pour the cold water into your cup until you can do it without spilling. Then practise with the kettle half-boiled. Slowly work your way up until the kettle is fully boiled.</p>
<h4 id="ovens"><a class="header" href="#ovens">Ovens</a></h4>
<p>Take a baking tray and fill it with things that rattle, like marbles, or dice, or screws, or even cutlery. Practise taking it from the kitchen side, and putting it into a cold oven, and closing the oven door. Do all of this with bare hands (ensuring the oven is cold first).</p>
<p>Walk around your kitchen, open the oven door, and get your tray out.</p>
<p>When you can do that with a minimum of rattling, repeat with oven gloves on. Then warm the oven a little (50 degrees will be warm, but not hot), and do the same.</p>
<p>Pro TIP: You can do the same with barbecues before they are lit.</p>
<h4 id="pans"><a class="header" href="#pans">Pans</a></h4>
<p>Fill your pans (both frying pans and saucepans) with cold water, and practise walking around with them. Do this with bare feet, so you'll feel any water that drops on your feet.</p>
<p>Keep doing this until you don't spill anything, and bear in mind, that even if you half fill a pan before cooking, water increases in volume when boiling, so it might appear far fuller when it has been on the heat for a while.</p>
<p>Pro TIP 1: Put whatever you are boiling in the pan before you put the water in, so you don't end up with a much higher water level than you expect.</p>
<p>Pro TIP 2: Experiment with using a bigger pan than you think you'll need. The sides will be higher, so there's less chance of the pan boiling over, oil splashing ETC. This is safer, more pleasant for you when cooking, and will likely result in less mess.</p>
<h3 id="telling-when-a-pan-is-centred"><a class="header" href="#telling-when-a-pan-is-centred">Telling when a pan is centred</a></h3>
<p>If you're using a gas hob, you can get a good idea if the pan is centred by holding your hand (palm or back) above your pan, and feeling for the hot air that rises. If your pan is not centred, you will likely feel extra hot air to the side you need to move the pan towards, to centre it over the flame.</p>
<p>When positioning your hand, start with it as high in the air as you can reach, then slowly bring it down until you feel the heat. Over time, no matter how tall you are, you will come to remember how high is too high, and how low is getting uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Irrespective what hob you're using, assuming it is not a <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hotplate">hotplate</a> or an <a href="https://www.cookersandovens.co.uk/blog/what-is-induction/">induction hob</a>, you can feel where about the pan should be situated before you apply any heat.</p>
<p>Pro TIP 1: In my experience (not scientific fact), the edge of a wok is usually warm rather than hot, so you can touch it to make sure the pan is the same temperature all the way around.</p>
<p>Pro TIP 2: If you're feeling your way around a pan, bounce your finger rather than dragging it. That way, if you do find it too hot, you'll realise your mistake before any kind of damage is done.</p>
<p>Pro TIP 3: Have a bowl of cold water run. That way, even if you do burn yourself, you can quickly submerge your finger in cold water to prevent the skin from burning. If you don't have a sink bowl, or you'd rather fill the sink with washing up, running cold water works just as well.</p>
<h3 id="draining-things"><a class="header" href="#draining-things">Draining things</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Always drain over an empty sink. The hot water can run away, and most colanders have a base, so you can sit them in the sink, and use both hands for holding / directing the pan.</li>
<li>Don't lean over when draining hot liquids. You might be tempted to lean towards your pan to hear how fas you are pouring, but there will most likely be a rush of steam which will rise when pouring, and if you're too close, it make your eyes water a bit.</li>
</ul>
